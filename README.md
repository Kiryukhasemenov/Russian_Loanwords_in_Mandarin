# Studies on Russian Loanword Adaptation in Chinese
### Kirill Semenov, Higher School of Economics - Moscow, 2018-2020
---
This is my two year's research on Russian phonetic loanwords in Mandarin Chinese.

The repository consists of three folders:
1. [`2019`](../../tree/master/2019) - the code for:
  - the analysis of prescriptive/observed data on Russian-to-Chinese transliteration;
  - the study on Russian consonant adaptation in Chinese;
  - the analysis parcial calques in Russian loanwords;
  - N-gram frequency analysis and character diversity of the Russian loanwords;
  - and the presentation of this research in eReL conference in Zagreb.

2. [`2020`](../../tree/master/2020) - the code for:
  - analysis of phonetical transformations of the Russian loans in Chinese ([phonetics](../../tree/master/2020/phonetics)), which includes:
    - consonant cluster analysis;
    - analysis of vowel transformations;
    - analysis of stress-to-tone transformation (draft);
  - data of the Russian allomorphy transformations in Chinese ([morphemes](../../tree/master/2020/morphemes)); 
  - comparison of the Chinese word segmentation (CWS) algorithms for the task of the Russian loanword detection - [CWS_algorithms](../../tree/master/2020/CWS_algorithms).

3. [`data`](../../tree/master/data) - the datasets necessary for the previous two studies.

4. [`2021`](../../tree/master/2021) - the code and the datasets for:
 - comparison of the Russian lexicon in Pidgin and in Putonghua;
 - comparison of the phonological and morphological transformations of ther Russian lexemes in both idioms.


You will find the detailed overviews of the code and data in the `README.md` files in each of the folders.
